        I have started my journey with the Udemy Bootcamp “The Web Developer
        Bootcamp 2022” with the instructor Colt Steele. I was immediately hooked
        up. The structure is clear. The content that is covered is all you need
        to get started. Nevertheless, for the sake of repeating and
        strengthening the use of the tools and technologies I have enrolled in
        another Udemy course “The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0”.

        During these courses I have built some static pages and cloned existing
        webpages. According to the principle "Learning by doing" I invested a
        lot of time just trying and “playing” with the learned technologies.

        After mastering the basics of JavaScript, I have started additionally to
        build some small games such as Snake, NBA memory game or Rock, Scissors,
        Paper. In the end of the Bootcamp, I have built a Yelp app clone. For
        this bigger project I have used Frontend and Backend tools. The
        application was built with JavaScript, NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.
        Additional learning content was: cookies and sessions, authentication
        and authorization, image upload and geocoding and maps.

        After finishing the Developer Bootcamps, I was interested in learning
        the basics of Software testing. So, I enrolled in a beginner Software
        testing Bootcamp that covered the general theory of testing, writing
        test cases and user stories. I got a good overview of postman, JIRA and
        Trello.

        My latest ambition is to master ReactJS. I finished the first beginner
        course of 11 hours at scrimba.com. The course contained 140 coding
        challenges. The final challenge was a game “Roll the dice”.
