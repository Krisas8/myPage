      In July 2021 after more than 5 successful years as a team lead at a global
      retailer I have decided to change my career path and do something totally
      different. I started paving my new path. Since then, I have successfully
      completed 2 Web Development Bootcamp courses and a Software Testing
      Bootcamp course. I have been working on several small private projects to
      constantly improve my skill set. I am looking for potential employers or
      partners to come along with me on my further web development journey.
